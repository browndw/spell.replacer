Description: Automatically replaces "misspelled" words in a character vector
    based on their string distance from a list of words sorted by their frequency
    in a corpus. The default word list provided in the package comes from 
    the Corpus of Contemporary American English. Uses the Jaro-Winkler distance
    metric for string similarity as implemented in van der Loo (2014) 
    <doi:10.32614/RJ-2014-011>. The word frequency data is derived from 
    Davies (2008-) "The Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA)"
